# equilibriated RNN for speech enhancement
In this repository, real-time speech enhancement method using the equilibriated recurrent neural network (ERNN) for the T-F mask estimator is impremented using Chainer.
In our paper, VoiceBank-DEMAND dataset (available on [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.7488/ds/1356)) is used.


### Dependencies

* Python 3.6.4
* Chainer 6.2.0
* NumPy 1.17.2
* CuPy 6.2.0
* CUDA Runtime Version 10100
* cuDNN Version 7500
